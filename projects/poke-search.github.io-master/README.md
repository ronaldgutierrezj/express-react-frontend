# PokeSearch
## An application that uses a combination of Javascript, jQuery, Ajax, HTML and CSS to build a mobile first application, with desktop compatibility.
### The Get Poke'mon info! button 
- uses an ajax function with an API from pokeapi.com to retrieve information and display of a speciffic pokemon that was searhced by name or ID number.
- the data retrieved displays the name, two different abilities and a image of the pokemon.
### The Next button
- uses a similar ajax function with the same API to inseated search by a ramdom ID number found using a random number function imbeded within the ajax url with jQuery.
- due to limitation of the api this function is completely random and does not show the next pokemon in sequential order.
### Other functionality
- used a default image for the display so the fresh page did not look to plain.
